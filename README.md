# Digital Forensics Case Studies

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of digital forensics case studies conducted as part of the CY5210 Information System Forensics course at Northeastern University. Each case demonstrates practical application of digital forensics methodologies, tools, and analysis techniques across various incident types.

## Repository Structure

### Case Studies

1. **Data Exfiltration Investigation** - Corporate insider threat involving unauthorized data transfer
2. **Possession of Prohibited Digital Content** - Investigation of policy violations and content possession
3. **Insider Threat Analysis** - Employee data theft and corporate espionage case
4. **Criminal Investigation** - Mass shooting planning and threat assessment

### Documentation Types

- **Forensic Reports** - Detailed analysis and findings for each case
- **Chain of Custody Forms** - Evidence handling documentation

## Forensic Tools Utilized

### Primary Analysis Tools
- **FTK Imager v4.7.1** - Disk imaging and evidence acquisition
